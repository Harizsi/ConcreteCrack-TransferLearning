# Concrete Crack - Transfer Learning

## Description
Concrete can develop cracks due to various reasons, including curing, shrinkage,
settlement, and design flaws. These cracks can pose safety risks and weaken the structure.
To address this issue, we can use AI to automatically identify cracked concrete from images.
This can help in early detection and timely repairs, potentially saving lives and preventing
structural failures
